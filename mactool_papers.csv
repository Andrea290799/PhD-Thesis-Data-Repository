Recent reports indicate that cytotoxic CD8+ cells are critically involved in the elicitation phase of contact hypersensitivity reactions. In this study, the in situ expression of IL-12 was investigated in normal human skin and in allergic contact dermatitis by immunohistochemistry. Skin biopsy specimens were obtained from allergic patch test reactions after 3 days, and from normal skin in 8 subjects. In contrast to normal skin, a strong enhancement of IL-12 immunoreactivity was observed in the mononuclear cell infiltrate of allergic contact dermatitis. IL-12 immunoreactivity was mainly located in the cytoplasm of dermal dendritic cells and macrophages as well as of some Langerhans cells. IL-12-positive cells were often found in close apposition to lymphocytes. Furthermore, positive immunostaining was also detected in keratinocytes at sites of marked exocytosis and spongiosis in the epidermis. In conclusion, the enhanced in situ expression of IL-12 may contribute to the activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and thereby represent an important factor in the pathogenesis of contact hypersensitivity reactions in humans.;Contact dermatitis;NA;Allergic Contact Dermatitis;D017449;ACD;NA;PM;IL12A;IL12B;Macrophage;Skin;Macrophage;2;target

We determined the level of expression of the constitutive (PGHS-1) and inducible (PGHS-2) isoforms of the enzyme in induced sputum and bronchial biopsies of patients with asthma, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and unaffected control subjects by immunocyto- and immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for PGHS-2 was significantly greater in the induced sputum of patients with asthma and patients with COPD compared with unaffected control subjects. The level of PGHS-2 was greater in asthma than in COPD. Immunoreactivity for PGHS-1 increased in cells in the induced sputum of patients with asthma and patients with COPD compared with that of unaffected control subjects. Immunostained cells included macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Greater PGHS-2 immunoreactivity was seen in the submucosal inflammatory infiltrate and in the airway epithelium of patients with asthma compared with unaffected control subjects. In summary, we demonstrate an induction of PGHS-2 in asthma, suggesting increased formation of prostanoids, which may contribute to the inflammatory process.;American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine;NA;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;PTGS2;Macrophage;Sputum;BALF/Lung Biopsy;Macrophage;1;target

Total cAMP PDE activity (pmol/min per mg protein) was significantly greater in homogenates prepared from monocytes from asthmatic subjects (68.3 +/- 7.0, n=9) compared to healthy individuals (46.3 +/- 3.3, n=14, P<0.05). The PDE inhibitors siguazodan (PDE3-selective), rolipram (PDE4-selective) and theophylline (non-selective) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of cAMP PDE activity in homogenates from monocytes from normal and asthmatic subjects. However, siguazodan produced significantly greater (P<0.05), and rolipram significantly less (P<0.05), inhibition of total cAMP PDE activity in monocytes from asthmatics (n=4) than from healthy individuals (n=5). cAMP PDE activity was inhibited with equal potency by theophylline in monocytes from healthy and asthmatic subjects. We also investigated the functional consequences of the changes in PDE activity in mononuclear cells obtained from asthmatic subjects. There was no significant difference in the ability of PDE4 inhibitors to attenuate TNF alpha release from monocytes obtained from asthmatic compared with healthy subjects (P>0.05). Despite a significant increase in the biochemical activity of PDE3 in monocytes from asthmatic subjects, the PDE3 inhibitor siguazodan, failed to significantly reduce TNF alpha release from human monocytes. Thus, total cAMP PDE activity is increased in monocytes taken from mild asymptomatic asthmatics compared to healthy subjects and is reflected by an increase in the proportion of PDE3 and a decrease in the proportion of PDE4. This augmented enzyme activity was not associated with an alteration in the ability of PDE4 inhibitors to attenuate mononuclear cell function from asthmatics compared to healthy individuals.;Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics;NA;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;TNF;PDE3A;PDE4A;Monocyte;Blood;Monocyte;3;target

11094642;YES;Elena Izquierdo;2000;NA;Journal Article;Lyprinol inhibits LTB4 production by human monocytes.;The effect of Lyprinol was evaluated on LTB4-induced human monocytes (normal and allergic donors) activation. Peripheral blood normal monocyte-derived monocytes when stimulated by Interleukin-4 (IL-4) produced high amounts of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) through the activation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Maximal effect was observed in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-4, and maximal LTB4 production was reached 40 min after the onset of stimulation. When stimulated for 48 h with IL-4, resting human monocytes expressed and released the low affinity receptor for IgE (CD23), and were inhibited in the presence of Lyprinol, or of the non redox 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (BW B70C), suggesting that the production of LTB4 partially contributed to the IL-4-induced CD23 expression and release. In addition to these phenotypical changes, IL-4 primed the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced luminol-dependent chemiluminescence response (LDCL) by normal human monocytes; this priming effect was abrogated in the presence of Lyprinol, or of BW B70C. Monocyte-derived monocytes from allergic patients spontaneously produced high amounts of LTB4, expressed CD23 expression, and had an increased oxidative metabolism. In the presence of Lyprinol, or of BW B70C, the hyper-activation of monocytes from allergic patients was significantly suppressed. Taken together, these data indicated that the pharmacological control of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in human monocytes can be achieved with Lyprinol, and that the activation of this pathway could upregulate the expression and release of CD23 and the respiratory burst of human monocytes.;Allergie et immunologie;NA;Immediate Hypersensitivity;D006969;IH;NA;PM;FCER2;Monocyte;Blood;Monocyte;1;target

We hypothesize that BMs from asthmatics may be modulated in their function compared with similar cells from healthy individuals. BMs obtained by induced sputum from mild asthmatics (n = 20) and healthy individuals (n = 20) were analyzed using flow cytometry for CD16, CD64, CD11b, CD14, and human leukocyte antigen-DR expression, phagocytosis of IgG opsonized yeast, and oxidant production. Asthma status was assessed by lung function [percent predicted forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))], percent sputum eosinophils, and nonspecific airway responsiveness [provocative concentration that produces a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20,FEV1))]. Asthmatics with >5% airway eosinophils (AEo+) had decreased BM CD64 expression and phagocytosis compared with asthmatics with <5% eosinophils (AEo-). Among asthmatics, a significant correlation was found between CD64 expression and BM phagocytosis (R = 0.7, P < 0.009). Phagocytosis was also correlated with PC(20,FEV1) (R = 0.6, P < 0.007), lung function (%predicted FEV(1), R = 0.7, P < 0.002) and percent eosinophils (R = -0.6, P < 0.01). In conclusion, BM from asthmatics are functionally modulated, possibly by Th2 cytokines involved in asthma pathology.;American journal of physiology.

11238657;YES;Mariona Pascal;2001;10.4049/jimmunol.166.6.4083;Journal Article;Histamine induces exocytosis and IL-6 production from human lung macrophages through interaction with H1 receptors.;Increasing evidence suggests that a continuous release of histamine from mast cells occurs in the airways of asthmatic patients and that histamine may modulate functions of other inflammatory cells such as macrophages. In the present study histamine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) increased in a concentration-dependent fashion the basal release of beta-glucuronidase (EC(50) = 8.2 +/- 3.5 x 10(-9) M) and IL-6 (EC(50) = 9.3 +/- 2.9 x 10(-8) M) from human lung macrophages. Enhancement of beta-glucuronidase release induced by histamine was evident after 30 min and peaked at 90 min, whereas that of IL-6 required 2-6 h of incubation. These effects were reproduced by the H(1) agonist (6-[2-(4-imidazolyl)ethylamino]-N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)heptane carboxamide but not by the H(2) agonist dimaprit. Furthermore, histamine induced a concentration-dependent increase of intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) that followed three types of response, one characterized by a rapid increase, a second in which [Ca(2+)](i) displays a slow but progressive increase, and a third characterized by an oscillatory pattern. Histamine-induced beta-glucuronidase and IL-6 release and [Ca(2+)](i) elevation were inhibited by the selective H(1) antagonist fexofenadine (10(-7)-10(-4) M), but not by the H(2) antagonist ranitidine. Inhibition of histamine-induced beta-glucuronidase and IL-6 release by fexofenadine was concentration dependent and displayed the characteristics of a competitive antagonism (K(d) = 89 nM). These data demonstrate that histamine induces exocytosis and IL-6 production from human macrophages by activating H(1) receptor and by increasing [Ca(2+)](i) and they suggest that histamine may play a relevant role in the long-term sustainment of allergic inflammation in the airways.;Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);NA;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;GUSB;IL6;Macrophage;BALF/Lung Biopsy;Macrophage;2;target

We hypothesized that CD80 and CD86 on alveolar macrophages could differentially support allergic inflammation in adult asthma. Here we studied 11 subjects with mild allergic asthma and 11 atopic non-asthmatics as controls. Dermatophagoides-specific T cell lines were derived from peripheral blood from each subject. Bronchoalveolar lavage with evaluation of lung inflammatory cells was performed in all individuals at baseline and 24 h after allergen challenge. The expression of CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules by alveolar macrophages was studied and, in parallel, the efficiency of antigen presentation was measured in terms of IL-4 and IL-5 production by allergen-stimulated autologous T cells. We found that in asthmatic subjects (i) the percent of CD80+, but not CD86+ alveolar macrophages was increased at baseline and did not change following allergen challenge; (ii) CD86, but not CD80, membrane expression was up-regulated following allergen challenge; (iii) both CD80 and CD86 were required to support Th2 cytokine production by allergen-specific T cells, with a prevalent role of CD86 after allergen challenge. Our data indicate that alveolar macrophages deliver costimulatory signals via CD80 and CD86, which support the production of Th2 cytokines by allergen-specific T cells. They also indicate that CD86 in vivo is up-regulated in the 24 h following allergen exposure and that this modulation is functionally relevant.;Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology;NA;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;CD80;CD86;IL4;IL5;Macrophage;BALF/Lung Biopsy;Macrophage;4;target

In order to unravel similarities and differences of both atopic dermatitis subtypes, the phenotype of monocytes, total serum IgE levels, and serum levels of cytokines regulating the IgE production from nonatopic individuals and patients with allergic rhinitis, and extrinsic and intrinsic atopic dermatitis were measured. Concomitantly, genomic DNA probes of all subjects were analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms of candidate genes of structures involved in the regulation of the IgE synthesis, such as interleukin-4 and the interleukin-4R/interleukin-13R. Our data show that the surface expression of the high- and low-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI and FcepsilonRII/CD23) and the interleukin-4Ralpha chain were significantly elevated in monocytes from patients with extrinsic atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, serum levels of interleukin-13 were significantly increased in patients with intrinsic atopic dermatitis. In addition, the frequency of the interleukin-4Ralpha polymorphism C3223T and the interleukin-4 polymorphism C590T tended to be higher in extrinsic atopic dermatitis than in intrinsic atopic dermatitis. Altogether our findings indicate that intrinsic atopic dermatitis patients exhibit phenotypic and immunologic features, which differ from those of patients with extrinsic atopic dermatitis or other atopic disorders.;The Journal of investigative dermatology;NA;Atopic Dermatitis;Allergic Rhinitis;D003876;D065631;AD;AR;NA;PM;IL4R;MS4A2;FCER2;Monocyte;Blood;Monocyte;3;target

Prolonged eosinophilic inflammation depends on the balance between the cell's inherent tendency to undergo apoptosis and the local eosinophil-viability enhancing activity. TRAIL, a member of the TNF family, induces apoptosis in most transformed cells; however, its role in health and disease remains unknown. To test the hypothesis that Ag-induced inflammation is associated with TRAIL/TRAIL-R interactions, we used a segmental Ag challenge (SAC) model in ragweed-allergic asthmatics and nonasthmatic patients and analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) material for 2 wk. In asthmatic patients, the level of TRAIL in BAL fluid dramatically increased 24 h after SAC, which significantly correlated with BAL eosinophil counts. Immunohistochemical analysis of bronchial biopsies from asthmatic patients demonstrated that TRAIL staining was increased in epithelial, airway smooth muscle, and vascular smooth muscle cells and throughout the interstitial tissue after SAC. This was confirmed by quantitative immunocytochemical image analysis of BAL eosinophils and alveolar macrophages, which demonstrated that expression levels of TRAIL and DcR2 increased, whereas expression levels of the TRAIL-Rs DR4 and DR5 decreased in asthmatic subjects after SAC. We also determined that TRAIL prolongs eosinophil survival ex vivo. These data provide the first in vivo evidence that TRAIL expression is increased in asthmatics following Ag provocation and suggest that modulation of TRAIL and TRAIL-R interactions may play a crucial role in promoting eosinophil survival in asthma.;Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);NA;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;TNFSF10;HLA-DRB4;TNFRSF10B;TNFRSF10D;Monocyte;Macrophage;Blood;BALF/Lung Biopsy;Monocyte;Macrophage;4;target

Fc epsilon RI is strongly upregulated on APCs from atopic donors and involved in the pathophysiology of atopic diseases. Despite its clinical relevance, data about Fc epsilon RI regulation on APCs are scarce. We show that in all donors intracellular alpha chain of the Fc epsilon RI (Fc epsilon RI alpha) accumulates during DC differentiation from monocytes. However, expression of gamma chains of the Fc epsilon RI (Fc epsilon RI gamma), mandatory for surface expression, is downregulated. It is low or negative in DCs from normal donors lacking surface Fc epsilon RI (Fc epsilon RI(neg) DCs). In contrast, DCs from atopics express surface Fc epsilon RI (Fc epsilon RI(pos) DCs) and show significant Fc epsilon RI gamma expression, which can be coprecipitated with Fc epsilon RI alpha. In Fc epsilon RI(neg) DCs lacking Fc epsilon RI gamma, immature and core glycosylated Fc epsilon RI alpha accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. In Fc epsilon RI(pos) DCs expressing Fc epsilon RI gamma, an additional mature form of Fc epsilon RI alpha exhibiting complex glycosylation colocalizes with Fc epsilon RI gamma in the Golgi compartment. IgE binding sustains surface-expressed Fc epsilon RI on DCs from atopic donors dependent on baseline protein synthesis and transport and enhances their IgE-dependent APC function. We propose that enhanced Fc epsilon RI on DCs from atopic donors is driven by enhanced expression of otherwise limiting amounts of Fc epsilon RI gamma and is preserved by increased IgE levels.;The Journal of clinical investigation;NA;Atopic Dermatitis;Allergic Rhinitis;Allergic Asthma;D003876;D065631;D001249;AD;AR;AAsthma;NA;PM;FCER1A;Monocyte;Blood;Monocyte;1;target

Dexamethasone suppressed LPS-induced granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-8 release by 83 +/- 1%, 51 +/- 7% and 20 +/- 9% (p < 0.001), respectively. Similar effects were seen on nuclear factor-kappaB inhibition, and interleukin-8 release was further reduced by the HDAC enhancer, theophylline (37 +/- 6%). Prednisolone increased HDAC activity in PBMCs from subjects with mild asthma. The increased inflammatory response in asthma may be due to reduced HDAC and enhanced HAT activity. Glucocorticoids and theophylline may downregulate the inflammatory response by modulating HAT and HDAC activity, and nuclear factor-kappaB activation.;American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine;NA;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;HDAC1;TMPRSS11D;Macrophage;BALF/Lung Biopsy;Macrophage;2;target

The present study investigated the expression of both human glutaredoxins in cultured human lung cells and lung homogenates by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Immunohistochemical studies were conducted with 38 human lung specimens, including healthy lung, parenchymal sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The ultrastructural localization of Grx1 was assessed by immunoelectron microscopy. In addition, cultured airway epithelial cells were exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Both Grx1 and Grx2 could be detected at the mRNA and protein level in cultured human lung cells, but only Grx1 was prominently expressed in lung homogenates and alveolar macrophages. Immunohistochemically, Grx1 was highly concentrated to alveolar macrophages and weakly positive in the bronchial epithelium. Grx1 was ultrastructurally localized to the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and nucleus. The expression of Grx1 decreased in alveolar macrophages of sarcoidosis and allergic alveolitis compared with the case for controls (P < 0.001), and bronchial epithelium of these diseases revealed no Grx1 immunoreactivity. Fibroblast foci and other fibrotic areas in UIP were mainly negative. In A549 cells, Grx1 was down-regulated by TGF-beta, whereas TNF-alpha caused no clear effect. Overall, high expression of Grx1 in alveolar macrophages suggests its importance in the primary defense of human lung. Decreased expression of Grx1 further suggests the impairment of this system both in inflammatory and fibrotic lung diseases, consistent with the down-regulation of Grx1 by TGF-beta in vitro.;Human pathology;NA;Allergic Alveolitis;D000542;AAlveolitis;NA;PM;GLRX;Macrophage;BALF/Lung Biopsy;Macrophage;1;target

Chemokines are pivotal in mediating the attraction of leucocytes to sites of inflammation. The CC-chemokine, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2), is expressed by keratinocytes in both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. MCP-1 binds to the chemokine receptor CCR2 which is known to be expressed on monocytes and macrophages. We examined the expression of CCR2 on peripheral blood monocytes from patients with psoriasis (n=8) and atopic dermatitis (n=7) and found it to be expressed on approximately 90% of the cells, whereas monocytes from healthy donors had a significantly lower CCR2 expression (p<0.05). Skin biopsies from patients suffering from atopic dermatitis and psoriasis revealed that CCR2-positive cells expressed CD163, a marker for monocytes/macrophages. However, not all CD163-positive cells expressed CCR2, which could be interpreted as a mechanism for retaining the macrophages in the skin. Furthermore, we found that keratinocytes are able to express MCP-1, when stimulated with tumour necrosis factor-alpha and/or interferon-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. Thus MCP-1 and CCR2 interaction is likely of importance for the monocyte/macrophage trafficking of inflammatory skin disorders.;Acta dermato-venereologica;NA;Atopic Dermatitis;D003876;AD;NA;PM;CCR2;CCL2;Monocyte;Blood;Monocyte;2;target

Exposure to allergens or bacterial superantigens triggers T and dendritic cell (DC) recruitment and induces atopic skin inflammation. In this study, we report that among all known chemokines CCL18/DC-CK1/PARC represents the most highly expressed ligand in atopic dermatitis. Moreover, CCL18 expression is associated with an atopic dermatitis phenotype when compared with other chronic inflammatory skin diseases. DCs either dispersed within the dermis or clustering at sites showing perivascular infiltrates are abundant sources of CCL18. In vitro, microbial products including LPS, peptidoglycan, and mannan, as well as the T cell-derived activation signal CD40L, induced CCL18 in monocytes. In contrast to monocytes, monocyte-derived, interstitial-type, and Langerhans-type DCs showed a constitutive and abundant expression of CCL18. In comparison to Langerhans cells, interstitial-type DCs produced higher constitutive levels of CCL18. In vivo, topical exposure to the relevant allergen or the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B, resulted in a significant induction of CCL18 in atopic dermatitis patients. Furthermore, in nonatopic NiSO4-sensitized individuals, only relevant allergen but not irritant exposure resulted in the induction of CCL18. Taken together, findings of the present study demonstrate that CCL18 is associated with an atopy/allergy skin phenotype, and is expressed at the interface between the environment and the host by cells constantly screening foreign Ags. Its regulation by allergen exposure and microbial products suggests an important role for CCL18 in the initiation and amplification of atopic skin inflammation.;Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);NA;Atopic Dermatitis;D003876;AD;NA;PM;CCL18;Macrophage;Skin;Macrophage;1;target

We used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to examine the expression and cellular provenance of TSLP, Th2-attracting (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)/CCL17, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC)/CCL22, I-309/CCL1) and Th1-attracting (IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10)/CXCL10, IFN-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant (I-TAC)/CXCL11) chemokines and expression of their receptors CCR4, CCR8, and CXCR3 in bronchial biopsies from 20 asthmatics and 15 normal controls.

Since Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize microbial products, we hypothesized that maternal allergies may be associated with decreased levels of TLR2, TLR4 and CD14 mRNA in mothers and their offspring. 185 healthy pregnant women from Germany (n = 48), Hungary (n = 50) and Spain (n = 87) were enrolled in a European multicenter study. Levels of TLR2, TLR4 and CD14 mRNA were quantified in maternal peripheral blood samples taken at delivery and placental cord blood samples. Numbers of TLR2+, TLR4+ and CD14+ monocytes were quantified by flow cytometry in 42 cord blood samples obtained from the German participants. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. Maternal allergies were associated with significantly lower levels of TLR2/4/CD14 mRNA in maternal blood and cord blood samples. Maternal and fetal TLR2/4/CD14 mRNA levels were significantly correlated with each other (TLR2 r = 0.42; TLR4 r = 0.58; CD14 r = 0.54).

The IL-18 production by monocytes stimulated without or with LPS or A23187+PMA for 1day was measured by ELISA. The produced IL-18 spontaneously or in response to A23187+PMA by monocytes was significantly higher for volunteers with 105A/A genotype than with 105A/C genotype. Similarly, the production capability of IL-18 by monocytes from volunteers with -137G/G genotype was significantly higher than that with -137G/C genotype and significant linkage disequilibrium was observed between 105A/C and -137G/C polymorphism.

In this study, it is demonstrated that IL-4 and IL-13 induced CCL23 expression in human peripheral blood monocytes. GM-CSF had no effect on its own but synergized with IL-4, but not IL-13. CCL23 promoter reporter gene constructs were sensitive to IL-4 stimulation in the presence of the transcription factor STAT6. A canonical STAT6 binding site in the promoter region of the CCL23 gene was critical for the IL-4-inducible phenotype because reporter plasmids with a defective STAT6 binding site were unable to respond to IL-4 stimulation. In addition, two tandem copies of the STAT6 site conferred cytokine responsiveness to a heterologous minimal promoter. Furthermore, IL-4 inducibility of the CCL23 promoter was dependent on the absence of a negatively acting cis-element downstream of the STAT6 binding site. The negative function of this element was operative also on heterologous IL-4-inducible promoters. CCL23 was also expressed in skin from patients suffering from atopic dermatitis at higher levels than in normal individuals. However, no correlation between CCL23 expression in the serum and IgE levels as a diagnostic marker for atopy was found.

We investigated whether DC differentiated from monocytes from healthy and birch allergic asthmatic individuals and further maturated by stimulation with cat and birch allergens and LPS differ in their phenotypic receptor expression. Similar expression of DC surface markers, including HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, CD83, CD1a and CD11c, was detected in monocyte-derived DC from allergic and healthy individuals. Cells from healthy donors stimulated either antigen showed a similar activation of the CD80 and double CD80/CD86 costimulatory molecules when compared with non-stimulated cells. In the case of cells from allergic individuals, birch allergen was unable to produce the same increased expression of CD80 alone or in combination with CD80/CD86, in comparison with cells stimulated with cat and LPS. Levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1/MCAF and MIP-1beta were similar in the supernatant of non-stimulated DC from both groups of subjects.

Stimulation with birch and LPS resulted in an increased secretion of IL-12p70 in samples from healthy when compared with that in allergic individuals. The results suggest an impaired specific maturation of DC from birch allergic individuals in association with birch-specific immune responses.

In addition, little is known about potential in vivo responsiveness of BMs to pro- and anti-inflam-matory cytokines present in the bronchial milieu. We aimed to characterize asthmatic patients' BM subpopulations delineated by common markers of macrophage/monocyte cells, CD16 and CD14, and subsequently to analyze cytokine receptor expression on those subsets. Subjects included eighteen patients with moderate asthma (six steroid-naive and twelve steroid-treated) and ten healthy control subjects. Flow cytometry was used to analyze phenotypical features of BMs including expression of receptors for IL-10, IL-4 and IL-7. Exhaled nitric oxide analysis and induced sputum eosinophil counts were used to assess airway inflammation. BMs from both steroid-naive and steroid-treated asthmatic patients showed significantly decreased expression of CD16, as compared to healthy subjects' BMs. CD16, but not CD14, expression inversely correlated with exhaled nitric oxide levels and sputum eosinophilia. Short-term administration of inhaled cortiocosteroids (ICS) in steroid-naive asthmatic patients led to significant reduction of CD16 expression and enhancement of CD14 expression. Next, we analyzed the expression of receptors for IL-10, IL-4 and IL-7 on the surface of BM subpopulations characterized by different levels of CD14 and CD16 expression. We observed substantial levels of IL-10R on the surface of BMs collected from asthmatic and healthy subjects. Interestingly, IL-10R was found mostly on those macrophages that co-expressed CD14.

Relying on our previous data showing that Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) induced the activation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) through Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and that SEB-pulsed DCs commit allogenic naive T cells into T(H)2, we assessed monocytes sensitivity to SEB and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a group of children and adult patients with AD. Monocytes from AD patients (15 adults with mostly severe disease and 15 children with mild to moderate disease) exhibited an activated and tolerant state as supported by (i) secretion of large amounts of IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha even in the absence of stimulation; (ii) their inability to modulate neither HLA-DR and CD54 nor TLR2 and TLR4 expression after in vitro challenge with SEB; (iii) inhibition of IL-12p70 secretion in response to LPS. Interestingly, monocytes from some of the children studied responded to in vitro challenge with LPS, suggesting new hypotheses to explain disease regression. Our data support the notion that monitoring sensitivity of monocytes to bacterial toxins could prove useful to assess disease progression and prognosis in AD.;The Journal of investigative dermatology;NA;Atopic Dermatitis;D003876;AD;NA;PM;IL6;IL10;TNF;TLR4;Monocyte;Blood;Monocyte;4;target

Recently it was reported that CD16+ monocytes can be divided into two subsets with contrasting potential of modulating inflammatory responses, namely CD14++CD16+ and CD14+CD16+ monocytes. Here, we characterized and quantified CD14++CD16+ and CD14+CD16+ monocyte subsets in asthmatic patients in the context of severity of disease and different treatment options. Subjects included seventeen severe asthmatics and eighteen moderate asthmatics treated with moderate-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids (GCS), twenty nine steroid-naive mild asthmatics and fifteen healthy controls. First, we demonstrated that CD14++CD16+ monocytes, in contrast to CD14+CD16+ monocytes, present significantly higher expression of anti-inflammatory molecule CD163. The frequency of CD14++CD16+, but not CD14+CD16+ monocytes, was significantly higher in patients with severe asthma as compared to mild and moderate asthmatics. However, the frequency of both CD16+ monocyte subsets did not correlate directly with exhaled nitric oxide levels. Short-term administration of oral GCS in patients with exacerbations resulted in a preferential decrease of CD14+CD16+ monocytes.

Thus, the goal of this study is to better characterize AM phenotype of allergic asthmatic compared with normal subjects using genomic expression analyses. Microarray analyses were performed with AM isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage. Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) normalization and Smyth's moderated t test were used to select differentially expressed genes. Fifty differentially expressed genes were identified. Nineteen have been classified in categories linked to stress or immune responses and among them; nine are part of the heat shock protein (HSP) family. Difference of expression for three (HSPD1, PRNP, SERPINH1) of the five selected genes were validated using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the protein level of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), the protein encoded by HSPD1, and showed difference in AM protein level between allergic asthmatic and control subjects. In summary, this study suggests that HSP gene family, particularly HSP60, is involved in AM functions in a context of allergic asthma.

Recently, we demonstrated that extracellular adenosine triphosphate is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma by modulating the function of dendritic cells (DCs). However, the role of the purinergic receptor subtype P2X₇ is unknown. To elucidate the role of P2X₇R in allergic airway inflammation (AAI) in vitro and in vivo, P2X₇R expression was measured in lung tissue and immune cells of mice or in humans with allergic asthma. By using a specific P2X₇R-antagonist and P2X₇R-deficient animals, the role of this receptor in acute and chronic experimental asthma was explored. P2X₇R was found to be up-regulated during acute and chronic asthmatic airway inflammation in mice and humans. In vivo experiments revealed the functional relevance of this finding because selective P2X₇R inhibition or P2X₇R deficiency was associated with reduced features of acute and chronic asthma in the ovalbumin-alum or HDM model of AAI. Experiments with bone marrow chimeras emphasized that P2X₇R expression on hematopoietic cells is responsible for the proasthmatic effects of P2X₇R signaling. In the DC-driven model of AAI, P2X₇R-deficient DCs showed a reduced capacity to induce Th2 immunity in vivo. Up-regulation of P2X₇R on BAL macrophages and blood eosinophils could be observed in patients with chronic asthma. Our data suggest that targeting P2X₇R on hematopoietic cells (e.g., DCs or eosinophils) might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of asthma.;American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology;NA;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;WS;P2RX7;Macrophage;BALF/Lung Biopsy;Macrophage;1;target

Here, we wished to investigate whether phenotypic features of monocytes and CD4+ T cells in allergic patients are reciprocally related. Therefore, we recruited 50 untreated house dust mite-sensitive allergic rhinitis patients and 29 non-atopic healthy individuals and performed comprehensive simultaneous flow cytometric analysis of mutual correlations between levels of CD14, CD16, CD163, CD206, CD124 (IL-4R), CD210 (IL-10R) and CD25, CD124, CD127 (IL-7R), CD210, ICOS expression on monocytes and CD4+ T cells, respectively. We found that CD163 monocyte expression in allergic but not healthy subjects is positively correlated with monocyte IL-10R, and, to a lesser extent, CD206, but not IL-4R expression. Levels of CD163 expression were not related to frequencies of CD14++CD16-, CD14++CD16+, and CD14+CD16++ monocyte subsets. In contrast to healthy controls, intensities of monocyte IL-10R in allergic individuals were significantly correlated with monocyte CD206 and IL-4R expression. In addition, levels of monocyte IL-4R and IL-10R monocyte expression were positively correlated to expression of IL-4R and IL-10R on CD4+ T cells in both groups of studied subjects.

Whether this applies to human basophils and monocytes has not been established yet. Here, we sought to characterise the interaction between basophils and monocytes and identify the molecular determinants. A basophil-monocyte co-culture model revealed that IL-3 and basophil-derived IL-4 and IL-13 induced monocyte production of CCL17, a marker of alternative activation. Critically, IL-3 and IL-4 acted directly on monocytes to induce CCL17 production through histone H3 acetylation, but did not increase the recruitment of STAT5 or STAT6. Although freshly isolated monocytes did not express the IL-3 receptor α chain (CD123), and did not respond to IL-3 (as assessed by STAT5 phosphorylation), the overnight incubation with IL-4 (especially if associated with IL-3) upregulated CD123 expression. IL-3-activated JAK2-STAT5 pathway inhibitors reduced the CCL17 production in response to IL-3 and IL-4, but not to IL-4 alone. Interestingly, monocytes isolated from allergen-sensitised asthmatic patients exhibited a higher expression of CD123.

Adenosine levels are significantly increased in patients with bronchial asthma (BA) and mediate mast cell degranulation and bronchoconstriction. Over the last decade, increasing evidence has shown that adenosine can modulate the innate immune response during monocytes differentiation towards mature myeloid cells. These adenosine-differentiated myeloid cells, characterized by co-expression of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cell markers such as CD14 and CD209, produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of BA and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We found that expression of ADORA2A and ADORA2B are increased in monocytes obtained from patients with BA, and are associated with the generation of CD14(pos)CD209(pos) pro-inflammatory cells. A positive correlation between expression of ADORA2B and IL-6 was identified in human monocytes and may explain the increased expression of IL-6 mRNA in asthmatics.

The results showed that the levels of IFN-λ2 were elevated by 17.9% and 14.2% in the plasma of allergic rhinitis (AR) and combined rhinitis with asthma (AR + AS), which was positively correlated with the level of tryptase but negatively correlated with the level of IL-10. IFN-λ2 was predominately expressed in the CD16+ cells and CD14+ cells in healthy control subjects (HC) but upregulated only in CD8+ cells of AR and in eosinophils of asthma. It was observed that approximately 6.6% and 7.0% dispersed tonsil cells and 5.8% and 0.44% dispersed lung cells are IFN-λ2+ mast cells and macrophages. Moreover, tryptase and agonist peptides of PAR-2 induced enhanced IFN-λ2 mRNA expression in A549 cells. In conclusion, the elevated levels of IFN-λ2 in the plasma of AR and AR + AS indicate that IFN-λ2 is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic airway disorders. The potential origins of the elevated plasma IFN-λ2 include mast cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells in tissues, neutrophils, monocytes, CD8+ T cells, and eosinophils in peripheral blood.

Notably, cells that are actively involved in the pathological process have altered expression of cytokine receptors. However, standard evaluation of cells by flow cytometry measures only the percentage of cells expressing the appropriate marker, which is not enough for a full assessment of these changes. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the expression of IL-1β cytokine receptors in patients with atopic dermatitis by both percentage of cells with receptors in various subsets and the absolute number of membrane-bound receptors themselves. It was found that an increase or decrease in the percentage of cells expressing the receptors in subsets of immune cells in patients with atopic dermatitis was not associated with a change in the number of receptors on the cell surface. Moreover, the changes in the percentage of cells and the number of receptors may occur in different directions, as shown for IL-1R2 expression on B cells and IL-1R1 expression for monocytes. Changes in the parameters of IL-1β receptor expressions are associated with disease severity index SCORAD in atopic dermatitis.

However, little is known of expression levels of PARs on monocytes of allergic patients, and influence of serine proteases and PARs on TNF-α secretion from monocytes. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and flowcytometry techniques, we observed that the expression level of PAR-2 in monocytes of patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma was increased by 42.9 and 38.2 %. It was found that trypsin, thrombin, and tryptase induced up to 200, 320, and 310 % increase in TNF-α release from monocytes at 16 h, respectively. PAR-1 agonist peptide, SFLLR-NH2, and PAR-2 agonist peptide tc-LIGRLO-NH2 provoked up to 210 and 240 % increase in release of TNF-α. Since SCH 79797, a PAR-1 antagonist, and PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK inhibited thrombin- and SFLLR-NH2-induced TNF-α release, the action of thrombin is most likely through a PAR-1- and ERK-mediated signaling mechanism. Similarly, because FSLLRN-NH2, an inhibitor of PAR-2 diminished tryptase- and tc-LIGRLO-NH2-induced TNF-α release, the action of tryptase appears PAR-2 dependent. Moreover, in vivo study showed that both recombinant cockroach major allergens Per a 1 and Per a 7 provoked upregulation of PAR-2 and PAR-1 expression on CD14+ cells in OVA-sensitized mouse peritoneum. In conclusion, increased expression of PAR-2 in monocytes of AR and asthma implicates that PAR-2 likely play a role in allergy.

S100A9 exists as one of the proteins in the neutrophils, triggering inflammatory responses by activating the immune cells. In this study, we investigated whether S100A9 affects constitutive neutrophil apoptosis by activating the monocytes in normal and allergic subjects. Supernatant from human monocytic THP-1 cells after treatment with S100A9 suppressed normal neutrophil apoptosis by inhibiting the activations of caspase 9 and caspase 3. S100A9 upregulated the release of MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in THP-1 cells. An increase in cytokine was suppressed by CLI-095, a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 inhibitor, PP2, a Src inhibitor, rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor, MAP kinase inhibitors, including PD98059, SB202190, and SP600125, and BAY-11-7085, an NF-κB inhibitor. Src, PKCδ, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK were phosphorylated by S100A9. The phosphorylation of Src and PKCδ was suppressed by CLI-095, and the activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK was inhibited by CLI-095, PP2, and rottlerin. S100A9 induced NF-κB activity, and the activation was suppressed by CLI-095, PP2, rottlerin, and MAPK kinase inhibitors. In normal and allergic subjects, supernatant from normal and allergic monocytes after stimulation with S100A9 suppressed normal and allergic neutrophil apoptosis, respectively; MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in the supernatant was increased by S100A9. The cytokine secretion induced by S100A9 is related to TLR4, Src, PKCδ, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB. Taken together, S100A9 induces anti-apoptotic effect on normal and allergic neutrophils by increasing cytokine secretion of monocytes.

This is largely due to lack of information on expression of IL-18 binding protein (BP) and IL-18 receptor (R) in asthma. In this study, we found that plasma levels of IL-18 and IL-18BP were elevated in asthma. The ratio between plasma concentrations of IL-18 and IL-18BP was 1:12.8 in asthma patients. We demonstrated that 13-fold more monocytes, 17.5-fold more neutrophils and 4.1-fold more B cells express IL-18BP than IL-18 in asthmatic blood, suggesting that there is excessive amount of IL-18BP to abolish actions of IL-18 in asthma. We also discovered that more IL-18R+ monocytes, neutrophils and B cells are located in asthmatic blood. Once injected, IL-18 eliminated IL-18R+ monocytes in blood, but up-regulated expression of IL-18R in lung macrophages of OVA-sensitized mice. Our data clearly indicate that the role of IL-18 in asthma is very likely to be determined by balance of IL-18/IL-18BP/IL-18R expression in inflammatory cells.

However, molecular factors involved in this process are not fully elucidated. Here, we show that cytokine IL-4 which is implicated in the development of chronic inflammatory disease atopic dermatitis (AD) induces expression of transcription factor FoxQ1 in human monocytes and macrophages. FoxQ1 mRNA levels were elevated in monocytes of AD patients compared to healthy donors. Overexpression of FoxQ1 in RAW 264.7 monocytic cells facilitated their migration towards MCP-1 and was associated with decreased expression of migration-regulating genes (claudin 11 and plexin C1). Furthermore, FoxQ1 overexpression in RAW cells accelerated TNFα secretion after LPS challenge. Overall, our results indicate that FoxQ1 stimulates monocyte motility, increases pro-inflammatory potential, and directs monocyte migration towards MCP-1 that is crucial for monocyte influx into inflammatory sites.

TSLP and IL-33 are important alarmins of allergic response associated with Th2 inflammation. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of the receptors for epithelial derived cytokines: TSLP (TSLPR) and IL-33 (ST2) on induced sputum CD206 positive macrophages from asthma and healthy subjects and analyze the relationships between these receptors and clinical features of the disease. Methods: Immunofluorescence staining for CD206 and TSLPR or ST2 on sputum macrophages was performed in 20 adult patients with stable asthma - 75% with atopy (3 intermittent, 12 mild-to-moderate, 5 severe, of which 11 were on biological anty-IgE treatment) and 23 healthy adult controls - 48% with atopy. Results: Our study demonstrated an increased expression of TSLP and IL-33 receptors on bronchial CD206 positive macrophages in asthma group. TSLPR but not ST2 had also greater expression on CD206 negative macrophages in asthma patients. Increased expression of both investigated receptors was related to longer disease duration and impaired lung function. We observed increased count of CD206lowTSLPhigh macrophages as well as positive correlation of these cells with total serum IgE in patients with atopy.

Currently, the heterogeneous human cutaneous DC population is incompletely characterized, and its contribution to these diseases remains unclear. Here, we performed index-sorted single-cell flow cytometry and RNA sequencing of lesional and nonlesional AD and PSO skin to identify macrophages and all DC subsets, including the newly described mature LAMP3+BIRC3+ DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDC) and CD14+ DC3.

In this study, we examined the role of long non-coding RNA taurine upregulated 1 (lncRNA TUG1) in asthma. We found that lncRNA TUG1 is one of the differentially expressed lncRNAs in the monocytes of asthmatic children and is associated with Th cell differentiation. LncRNA TUG1 and miR-29c are mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of macrophages. Our data suggested that lncRNA TUG1 increased in macrophages stimulated by House Dust Mite in a dose-dependent manner. Using loss- and gain of function strategy, we found that miR-29c might regulate Th2 cell differentiation by directly targeting co-stimulatory molecule B7-H3. Furthermore, down-regulation of lncRNA TUG1 decreased the level of GATA3 in CD4+T cells and was associated with miR-29c/B7-H3 axis. Moreover, the dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that lncRNA TUG1 serves as a competing endogenous RNA to sponge miR-29c. According to the rescue experiment, lncRNA TUG1 regulated Th2 cell differentiation via miR-29c. These data suggest that lncRNA TUG1 in macrophages regulates Th2 cell differentiation via miR-29c/B7-H3 axis.;Frontiers in immunology;B7-H3, T helper cell, bronchial asthma, long non-coding RNA taurine upregulated 1, macrophages, miRNA-29c;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;TUG1;Monocyte;Blood;Monocyte;1;target

We investigated the role of histamine in CCL18 production in human monocyte-derived M2 macrophages differentiated in the presence of M-CSF and activated with IL-4, IL-13 or with IL-10. Since expression and regulation of histamine H1 receptor (H1R), H2R and H4R by IL-4 and IL-13 on human M2 macrophages were described, we analyzed expression of the histamine receptors in response to IL-10 stimulation by quantitative RT-PCR. IL-10 upregulated H2R and downregulated H4R mRNA expression by trend in M2 macrophages. IL-10, but in a more pronounced manner, IL-4 and IL-13, also upregulated CCL18. Histamine increased the cytokine-induced upregulation of CCL18 mRNA expression by stimulating the H2R. This effect was stronger in IL-10-stimulated M2 macrophages where the upregulation of CCL18 was confirmed at the protein level by ELISA using selective histamine receptor agonist and antagonists. The histamine-induced CCL18 upregulation in IL-10-activated M2 macrophages was almost similar in cells obtained from atopic dermatitis patients compared to cells from healthy control persons. In summary, our data stress a new function of histamine showing upregulation of the Th2 cells attracting chemokine CCL18 in human, activated M2 macrophages.

Our study aims at screening macrophage-related gene signatures to build a risk prediction model and explore its predictive abilities in AS diagnosis. Three microarray datasets were downloaded from the GEO database. The Limma package was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AS and controls. The ssGSEA algorithm was used to determine immune cell proportions. The Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to select the macrophage-related DEGs. The LASSO and RFE algorithms were implemented to filter the macrophage-related DEG signatures to establish a risk prediction model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic ability of the prediction model. Finally, the qPCR was used to detect the expression of selected differential genes in sputum from healthy people and asthmatic patients. We obtained 1,189 DEGs between AS and controls from the combined datasets. By evaluating immune cell proportions, macrophages showed a significant difference between the two groups, and 439 DEGs were found to be associated with macrophages. These genes were mainly enriched in the gene ontology-biological process of immune and inflammatory responses, as well as in the KEGG pathways of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and biosynthesis of antibiotics. Finally, 10 macrophage-related DEG signatures (EARS2, ATP2A2, COLGALT1, GART, WNT5A, AK5, ZBTB16, CCL17, ADORA3, and CXCR4) were screened as an optimized gene set to predict AS diagnosis, and they showed diagnostic abilities with AUCs of 0.968 and 0.875 in ROC curves of combined and validation datasets, respectively. The mRNA expressions of EARS2, ATP2A2, COLGALT1, and GART in the control group were higher than in AS group, while the expressions of WNT5A, AK5, ZBTB16, CCL17, ADORA3, and CXCR4 in the control group were lower than that in the AS group.

To understand the inflammatory status in AD, we investigated the inflammasome complex, that activates ASC (Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), caspase-1 and GSDMD (gasdermin-D), and production of IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-18. We aimed to evaluate the expression of the inflammasome pathway in the skin of adults with AD. Thirty patients with moderate to severe AD and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in the study.

The main findings included increased expression of NLRP3, NLRP1 and AIM-2 at dermal level of severe AD; augmented IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2; expression at epidermis of moderate and severe patients, and in the dermis of severe AD; augmented expression of ASC, caspase-1 and GSDMD in both epidermis and dermis of moderate and severe AD.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a role in the skewed T cell activation. The objective of this project is to elucidate the role of IL-33 derived from macrophages in inducing Th2 polarization in the airways. In this study, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were collected from patients with asthma and healthy control subjects. Macrophages were isolated from the BALF by flow cytometry cell sorting. An asthmatic mouse model was established using the ovalbumin/alum protocol. The results showed that increased IL33 gene activity and ER stress-related molecules in BALF-derived M2a macrophages was observed in asthmatic patients. Levels of IL33 gene activity in M2a cells were positively correlated with levels of asthma response in asthma patients. Sensitization exacerbated the ER stress in the airway macrophages, which increased the expression of IL-33 in macrophages of airway in sensitized mice. Conditional ablation of Il33 or Perk or Atf4 genes in macrophages prevented induction of airway allergy in mice. In conclusion, asthma airway macrophages express high levels of IL-33 and at high ER stress status.

Studies were conducted in asthmatic patients and macrophage-specific Mbd2 knockout mice to dissect the role of MBD2 in asthma pathogenesis. Additionally, RNAi-based therapy with Mbd2 siRNA-loaded liposomes was conducted in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation mouse model. Asthmatic patients and mice challenged with OVA exhibited upregulated MBD2 expression in macrophages, especially in alternatively activated (M2) macrophages. In particular, macrophage-specific knockout of Mbd2 protected mice from OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation and suppressed the M2 program. Notably, intratracheal administration of liposomes carrying Mbd2 siRNA decreased the expression of Mbd2 and prevented OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation in mice, as indicated by the attenuated airway inflammation and mucus production. The above data indicate that Mbd2 implicates in the pathogenesis of asthma predominantly by regulating the polarization of M2 macrophages, which supports that Mbd2 could be a viable target for treatment of asthma in clinical settings.;Frontiers in immunology;MBD2, alternatively activated macrophages, asthma, liposomes, macrophage;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;MBD2;NA;BALF/Lung Biopsy;Macrophage;1;target

Recently, focus on the role of the innate immune system has been highlighted. Therefore, this study explores the role of circulating monocytes and natural killer (NK) clusters in childhood asthma.Methods: This case-control study enrolled 50 children with asthma divided equally into severe and mild groups and 26 healthy children. Flow-cytometry analysis was used to identify circulating blood monocytes and natural killers' subsets. In addition, pulmonary function test (spirometry) for children with asthma was performed.Results: This study showed significant negative correlations between frequency of total circulating, classical, intermediate, and nonclassical monocytes with ratio of forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.637, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.575, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.657, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.329, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004, respectively).

Monocytes cultured of these donors allowed us to examine circadian protein expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages, M1- and M2- polarized macrophages. In monocytes, particularly from allergic asthmatics, the oscillating expression of circadian proteins CLOCK, BMAL, REV ERBs, and RORs was significantly altered. Similar changes in BMAL1 were observed in polarized macrophages from allergic donors and in tissue-resident macrophages from activated precision cut lung slices. We confirmed clock modulating, anti-inflammatory, and lung-protective properties of the inverse ROR agonist SR1001 by reduced secretion of macrophage inflammatory protein and increase in phagocytosis. Using a house dust mite model, we verified the therapeutic effect of SR1001 in vivo.

We performed spatial transcriptomics sequencing to characterize the cellular infiltrate in lesional skin. For single-cell analysis, we analyzed the single-cell data from suction blister material from AD lesions and HC skin at the antecubital fossa skin (4 ADs and 5 HCs) and full-thickness skin biopsies (4 ADs and 2 HCs). The multiple proximity extension assays were performed in the serum samples from 36 AD patients and 28 HCs. The single-cell analysis identified unique clusters of fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the lesional AD skin. Spatial transcriptomics analysis showed the upregulation of COL6A5, COL4A1, TNC, and CCL19 in COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts in the leukocyte-infiltrated areas in AD skin.

Although the pathological functions of macrophages in skin are known, mechanisms of how they detect the tissue environment remain unknown. TRPV4, a nonselective cation channel with high Ca2+ permeability, is activated at physiological temperatures from 27 to 35&#xb0;C and involved in the functional control of macrophages.

We retrieved the gene expression matrix from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed MRGs (DE-MRGs) between healthy control (HC) and patients with HP were identified using the \DESeq2\ R package. The \clusterProfiler\ R package was used to perform \Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses\ on DE-MRGs. We used machine learning algorithms for screening diagnostic feature biomarkers for HP. The \receiver operating characteristic curve\ was used to evaluate diagnostic feature biomarkers' discriminating ability. Next, we used the \Cell-type Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA Transcripts\ algorithm to determine the infiltration status of 22 types of immune cells in the HC and HP groups. Single-cell sequencing and qRT-PCR were used to validate the diagnostic feature biomarkers. Furthermore, the status of macrophage polarization in the peripheral blood of patients with HP was determined using flow cytometry. Finally, the correlation between the proportion of M2 macrophages in peripheral blood and the diagnostic biomarker expression profile in HP patients was determined using Spearman analysis. We identified a total of 311 DE-MRGs. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed that DE-MRGs were primarily enriched in processes like steroid hormone biosynthesis, drug metabolism, retinol metabolism, etc. Finally, we identified NPR3, GPX3, and SULF1 as diagnostic feature biomarkers for HP using machine learning algorithms. The bioinformatic results were validated using the experimental results. The CIERSORT algorithm and flow cytometry showed a significant difference in the proportion of M2 macrophages in the HC and HP groups. The expression of SULF1 was positively correlated with the proportion of M2-type macrophages. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between SULF1 expression and M2 macrophage proportion.

We show that nasal DNA methylation has the strongest predictive power to diagnose childhood allergy, surpassing blood DNA methylation, genetic risk scores, and environmental factors. DNA methylation at only three nasal CpG sites classifies allergic disease in Dutch children aged 16 years well, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86. This is replicated in Puerto Rican children aged 9-20 years (AUC 0.82). DNA methylation at these CpGs additionally detects allergic multimorbidity and symptomatic IgE sensitization. Using nasal single-cell RNA-sequencing data, these three CpGs associate with influx of T cells and macrophages that contribute to allergic inflammation.

The molecular characteristics of elderly AD remain to be clarified. We sought to characterize the molecular features of skin lesions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with AD across different age, focusing on elderly AD. Skin and PBMCs samples were used for RNA sequencing. Analysis of differentially expressed genes and gene set variation analysis were performed. Immunofluorescence staining, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), flow cytometry and transwell assay were used for validation. Compared with healthy controls, the skin transcriptome of AD patients showed common signatures of AD, like barrier dysfunction and enhanced Th1/Th2/Th17 immune pathways. In PBMCs, the expression of Th1/Th2 response genes was more remarkable in adult AD, while expression of Th17-related genes was significantly higher in childhood AD. The gene modules associated with natural killer (NK) cells were downregulated in elderly AD. In skin lesions, elderly AD exhibited enrichment of macrophages, fibroblasts and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) related genes. The correlation among fibroblasts, SASP and innate immune cells were revealed by the co-localization of fibroblasts, macrophages and NK cells in the lesions across different age groups. Fibroblasts under inflammation or senescence could induce stronger chemotaxis of macrophages and NK cells. We identified the molecular phenotypes of skin lesions and PBMCs in elderly AD individuals. Fibroblasts, innate immune cells, and SASP might play important roles in the pathogenesis of elderly AD.;Journal of dermatological science;Atopic dermatitis, Fibroblasts, Innate immune cells, RNA sequencing, Senescence-associated secretory phenotype;Atopic Dermatitis;D003876;AD;NA;PM;ADGRE1;ITGAM;PPARG;CD80;CD86;ARG1;ADGRE3;ALOX5AP;APOBR;CDA;CEBPD;DGAT2;FPR1;IL1R2;LILRA2;MMP9;NA;Skin;Blood;Monocyte;Macrophage;16;untarget

Recent studies have revealed that Dectin-1 is overexpressed in asthma, but the specific mechanism remains elusive. Additionally, Dectin-1 has been implicated in promoting pyroptosis, a hallmark of severe asthma airway inflammation. Nevertheless, the involvement of the non-classical pyroptosis signal caspase-11/4 and its upstream regulatory mechanisms in asthma has not been completely explored. House dust mite (HDM)-induced mice was treated with Dectin-1 agonist Curdlan, Dectin-1 inhibitor Laminarin, and caspase-11 inhibitor wedelolactone separately. Subsequently, inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed. Western blotting was performed to measure the protein expression of caspase-11 and gasdermin D (GSDMD). Cell pyroptosis and the expression of chemokine were detected in vitro. The correlation between Dectin-1 expression, pyroptosis factors and neutrophils in the induced sputum of asthma patients was analyzed. Curdlan appeared to exacerbate neutrophil airway inflammation in asthmatic mice, whereas wedelolactone effectively alleviated airway inflammation aggravated by Curdlan. Moreover, Curdlan enhanced the release of caspase-11 activation fragments and N-terminal fragments of gasdermin D (GSDMD-N) stimulated by HDM both in vivo or in vitro. In mouse alveolar macrophages (MH-S cells), Curdlan/HDM stimulation resulted in vacuolar degeneration and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. In addition, there was an upregulation of neutrophil chemokines CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5 and their receptor CXCR2, which was suppressed by wedelolactone. In asthma patients, a positive correlation was observed between the expression of Dectin-1 on macrophages and caspase-4 (the human homology of caspase-11), and the proportion of neutrophils in induced sputum. Dectin-1 activation in asthma induced caspase-11/4 mediated macrophage pyroptosis, which subsequently stimulated the secretion of chemokines, leading to the exacerbation of airway neutrophil inflammation.;Respiratory research;Asthma, Caspase-11, Dectin-1, Neutrophil, Pyroptosis;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;CLEC7A;NA;Sputum;Macrophage;1;target

This study was to investigate the impact of exosome-derived miR-146a-3p on macrophage polarization in the pathology of AR. We detected the expression of miR-146a-3p in nasal tissues of AR patients and healthy controls (HCs), and investigated its correlation with macrophage polarization markers. The impact of miR-146a-3p derived from AR serum exosomes on macrophage polarization was examined. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on macrophages treated with a miR-146a-3p inhibitor, and target genes of miR-146a-3p were explored through a combination of bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation. The expressions of miR-146a-3p and macrophage polarization markers were increased in the AR nasal tissues, and a positive association was observed between the expressions of miR-146a-3p and the levels of CD163 and CD206. The AR serum exosomes could be uptake by macrophages, and promote M2 polarization and cytokine secretions. Mechanistically, miR-146a-3p regulation could impact both macrophage M2 polarization and cytokine secretion. Inhibition of miR-146a-3p altered the gene transcriptions within macrophages. Bioinformatics analysis and clinical pathological specimen research confirmed that VAV3 was a target gene of miR-146a-3p, and it exerted a detrimental effect on macrophage M2 polarization via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Functional recovery experiments and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays confirmed that miR-146a-3p could selectively target and inhibit the expression of VAV3, thereby promoting macrophage M2 polarization through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Serum exosome-derived miR-146a-3p facilitated macrophage M2 polarization in AR by targeting VAV3 through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These findings implied that miR-146a-3p and VAV3 could serve as potential targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in AR management.;International immunopharmacology;Allergic rhinitis, Exosome, Macrophages, VAV3, miR-146a-3p;Allergic Rhinitis;D065631;AR;NA;PM;CD163;MRC1;NA;Nasal Biopsy;Macrophage;2;target

However, the skin transcriptomic profiling of PN arising from atopic dermatitis (AD), so-called atopic PN (APN), remains unclear. We sought to explore the cutaneous transcriptome of APN with severe pruritus and compare it with classic AD. RNA sequencing was performed on the lesional skin from 13 APN to 11 AD patients with severe pruritus (itch numerical rating scale score&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;7) and normal skin from 11 healthy subjects. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunochemistry were used for validation. We detected 1085 and 1984 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lesional APN skin and lesional AD skin versus normal skin, respectively. In total, 142 itch/inflammation-related DEGs were identified. Itch/inflammation-related DEGs, such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, oncostatin M, and IL-4 receptor, had elevated gene transcript levels in both diseases. The itch/inflammation-related DEGs that increased only in APN were mainly neuroactive molecules, while many inflammatory mediators such as T helper 22-related genes were found to be increased only in AD. Both disorders showed mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 polarisation and impaired skin barrier. In contrast to AD, M1/M2 macrophage activation, tumor necrosis factor production, fibrosis, revascularization and neural dysregulation are unique features of APN.

The aim of this study was to assess the expression levels and dynamics of TNFRs on immune cells and to assess associations between their expression and severity of bronchial asthma (BA). Patients with severe (n = 8), moderate (n = 10), and mild (n = 4) BA were enrolled. As a comparison group, data from 46 healthy volunteers (HV) were accessed. Co-expression of TNFR1/2 was evaluated as a percentage of cells and the number of receptors of each type per cell. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify diagnostic biomarkers of BA. More than 90% of the monocytes in patients with mild BA were TNFR1+TNFR2+ but had significantly lower TNFR1 expression density compared with HV (7.82- to 14.08-fold, depending on disease severity). Lower percentages of the TNFR+ B-lymphocytes were observed in combination with significantly lower receptors density in BA compared with HV (2.59- to 11.64-fold for TNFR1 and 1.72- to 3.4-fold for TNFR2, depending on disease severity). The final multivariate model for predicting the presence of BA included the percentage of double-positive CD5+ B-lymphocytes and average number of TNFR1 molecules expressed on cytotoxic naive T-lymphocytes and T-helper cells (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.87). The co-expression patterns of TNFRs on immune cells in BA differed significantly compared with HV. The expression differences were associated with disease severity.

M2 macrophages are major immune cells associated with type 2 inflammation in asthma. This study investigated the effect of SP on macrophage phenotype in pediatric asthma and the underpinning factors. Asthmatic children exhibited an increased level of SP, along with a higher proportion of M2 macrophages in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Flow cytometry revealed that SP treatment enhanced the M2 polarization of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-treated THP-1 cells (macrophages) in&#xa0;vitro. By contrast, the administration of a neutralizing antibody of SP reduced the M2 macrophage population, mitigated inflammatory cell infiltration in mouse lung tissues, and decreased the population of immune cells in the mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SP up-regulated the expression of STAT6, which, in turn, activated the transcription of lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 (LCP2). The population of macrophages and allergic inflammatory responses in mice were reduced by STAT6 inhibition but restored by LCP2 overexpression. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that SP sustains M2 macrophage predominance and allergic inflammation in pediatric asthma by enhancing STAT6-dependent transcription activation of LCP2.;The American journal of pathology;NA;Allergic Asthma;D001249;AAsthma;NA;PM;CD68;MRC1;NA;BALF/Lung Biopsy;Macrophage;2;target

Systems-biology approaches were employed to decipher disease-relevant gene networks and deconvolution of associated cell populations. Solely in birch-allergic patients, co-expression analysis revealed activation of networks of innate immunity and antiviral signalling as the immediate response to Bet v 1&#xa0;stimulation. Toll-like receptors and signal transducer transcription were the main drivers of gene expression patterns. Macrophages and dendritic cells were the main cell subsets responding to Bet v 1.

We investigated whether ambient levels of fine PM with aerodynamic diameter &#x2264;2.5 microns (PM2.5 ) are associated with alterations in circulating monocytes in children with or without asthma. Monocyte phenotyping was performed by cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF). Cytokines were measured using cytometric bead array and Luminex assay. ChIP-Seq was utilized to address histone modifications in monocytes. Increased exposure to ambient PM2.5 was linked to specific monocyte subtypes, particularly in children with asthma. Mechanistically, we hypothesized that innate trained immunity is evoked by a primary exposure to fine PM and accounts for an enhanced inflammatory response after secondary stimulation in vitro. We determined that the trained immunity was induced in circulating monocytes by fine particulate pollutants, and it was characterized by the upregulation of proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF, IL-6, and IL-8, upon stimulation with house dust mite or lipopolysaccharide. This phenotype was epigenetically controlled by enhanced H3K27ac marks in circulating monocytes.

The cellular origins of IL-31 are generally considered to be TH2 cells. Macrophages have also been implicated as cellular sources of IL-31. We sought to determine the expression of IL-31 by macrophages and to elucidate the productive mechanisms and contributions to itch in AD skin lesions. Expression of IL-31 by macrophages, expressions of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and periostin, and presence of infiltrating basophils in human AD lesions were examined through immunofluorescent staining, and correlations were assessed. Furthermore, mechanisms of inducing IL-31-expressing macrophages were analyzed in an MC903-induced murine model for AD in&#xa0;vivo and in mouse peritoneal macrophages ex&#xa0;vivo. A significant population of IL-31<sup>+</sup> cells in human AD lesions was that of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells expressing CD163, an M2 macrophage marker.

In the MC903-induced murine AD model, significant scratching behaviors with enhanced expressions of TSLP and periostin were observed, accompanied by massive infiltration of basophils and IL-31<sup>+</sup>/MOMA-2<sup>+</sup>/Arg-1<sup>+</sup> cells. Blockade of IL-31 signaling with anti-IL-31RA antibody or direct depletion of macrophages by clodronate resulted in attenuation of scratching behaviors.

However, a comprehensive analysis of the importance of lipid metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) in regulating the immune microenvironment in asthma remains lacking. The transcriptome matrix was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. Differentially expressed analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) were conducted on the GSE74986 dataset to select hub LMRGs, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to explore their biological functions. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to determine immune infiltration in the asthma and control groups, and the correlation of diagnostic biomarkers and immune cells was performed via Spearman correlation analysis. Subsequently, a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed to investigate the hidden molecular mechanism of asthma. The expression levels of the hub genes were further validated in the GSE143192 dataset, and RT&#x2012;qPCR and immunofluorescence were performed to verify the reliability of the results in the OVA asthma model. Lastly, the ceRNA network was confirmed by qRT-PCR and RNAi experiments in the characteristic cytokine (IL-13)-induced asthma cellular model. ASAH1, ACER3 and SGPP1 were identified as hub LMRGs and were mainly involved in protein secretion, mTORC1 signaling, and fatty acid metabolism. We found more infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, activated NK cells, and monocytes and less M0 macrophage infiltration in the asthma group than in the healthy control group. In addition, ASAH1, ACER3, and SGPP1 were negatively correlated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and activated NK cells, but positively correlated with M0 macrophages. Within the ceRNA network, SNHG9-hsa-miR-615-3p-ACER3, hsa-miR-212-5p and hsa-miR-5682 may play crucial roles in asthma pathogenesis. The low expression of ASAH1 and SGPP1 in asthma was also validated in the GSE74075 dataset. After SNHG9 knockdown, miR-615-3p expression was significantly upregulated, while that of ACER3 was significantly downregulated.
